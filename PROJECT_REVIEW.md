# MIYA Protocol Project Review

## Project Overview
MIYA is a cross-chain mixer protocol built on Solana blockchain that provides privacy-focused asset transfers across different blockchains using zero-knowledge proof technology. The project aims to enable users to conduct private transactions while maintaining the benefits of blockchain technology's security and transparency.

## Current Structure

The project follows a modular architecture with these key components:

```

```

### Core Components:

1. **Solana Programs**: Four primary smart contracts
   - `mixer`: Manages privacy pools for asset deposits/withdrawals
   - `zkengine`: Handles zero-knowledge proof verification
   - `bridge`: Facilitates cross-chain asset transfers
   - `governance`: Controls protocol parameters and DAO operations

2. **Frontend**: React-based interface with wallet integration
   - Responsive design
   - Wallet connection (Phantom, etc.)
   - Integration with backend services

3. **SDK**: TypeScript library for developer integration
   - Abstraction for contract interactions
   - TypeScript types and interfaces
   - Utility functions

4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive protocol documentation
   - Architecture diagrams
   - API references
   - Implementation guides
