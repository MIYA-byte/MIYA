# MIYA Protocol Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the MIYA Protocol, a cross-chain mixer protocol built on Solana.

## Overview

MIYA Protocol is designed to provide privacy-focused asset transfers across different blockchains using zero-knowledge proof technology. The protocol is built with a modular architecture that allows for easy extensibility and integration with various blockchains.

### User Interface Layer

The frontend application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the MIYA Protocol. It includes:

- Web application built with React and TypeScript
- Wallet integration for connecting to Solana and other blockchains
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile users

### Developer API/SDK Layer

A set of tools and libraries that allow developers to integrate MIYA Protocol into their applications:

- JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for web applications
- API endpoints for programmatic access
- Documentation and examples

### Application Layer

The business logic layer that coordinates interactions between the UI, SDK, and the underlying protocol:

- Transaction management
- User account handling
- Fee calculation and management

### Cross-Chain Bridge Layer

Responsible for transferring assets between different blockchains:

- Chain adapters for each supported blockchain
- Cross-chain messaging and verification
- Liquidity management for smooth transfers

### Core Protocol Layer

The heart of MIYA Protocol, implementing the privacy-preserving mechanisms:

- **ZK Proof Engine**: Generates and verifies zero-knowledge proofs
- **Liquidity Pools**: Manages asset pooling and withdrawal logic
- **Protocol Governance**: Controls protocol parameters and upgrades

### Blockchain Network Layer

The underlying blockchains that MIYA Protocol interacts with:

- Primary: Solana blockchain
- Secondary: Ethereum, BSC, and other supported chains

## Solana Programs

The protocol consists of four main Solana programs:

1. **Mixer Program (miya_mixer)**:
   - Handles deposit and withdrawal operations
   - Manages commitment and nullifier tracking
   - Enforces privacy constraints

2. **ZK Engine Program (miya_zkengine)**:
   - Handles zero-knowledge proof verification
   - Manages verifier registration and updates
   - Provides cryptographic primitives

3. **Bridge Program (miya_bridge)**:
   - Manages cross-chain token mapping
   - Handles locking and releasing of tokens
   - Coordinates with external chain adapters

4. **Governance Program (miya_governance)**:
   - Manages protocol parameters
   - Handles voting on protocol upgrades
   - Controls treasury and fee distribution

## Data Model

Key entities in the protocol include:

- **Pools**: Fixed-size token pools for mixing
- **Deposits**: Encrypted records of user deposits
- **Nullifiers**: Used to prevent double-spending
- **Token Pairs**: Cross-chain token mappings
- **Chains**: Information about supported blockchains
- **Governance Proposals**: Protocol change proposals

## Security Considerations

The MIYA Protocol incorporates several security mechanisms:

- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy preservation
- Commitment-nullifier scheme to prevent double-spending
- Formal verification of critical components
- Multi-signature access control for admin functions
- Rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks

## Privacy Features

The protocol's privacy is ensured through:

- Ring signature-based mixing
- Zero-knowledge proofs for withdrawal verification
- Confidential transactions
- No on-chain linking between deposits and withdrawals

## Scalability Approach

MIYA Protocol addresses scalability through:

- Leveraging Solana's high throughput
- Optimized on-chain logic
- Batched proof verification
- Efficient cross-chain communication

## Future Extensions

The architecture is designed to support future extensions such as:

- Additional blockchain integrations
- Privacy-preserving DeFi primitives
- Institutional privacy solutions
- Enhanced governance mechanisms
